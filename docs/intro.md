# Introduction to Project Documentation

This documentation provides an overview and detailed information about the different aspects of the project. It serves as a guide for understanding the project structure, dataset, model files, and other relevant information. Below is the table of contents that includes links to each section for easy navigation:

- [Arduino Deployment](Arduino_Deployment.md)
- [Final Dataset](Final_Dataset.md)
- [Camera Capture](Camera_Capture.md)
- [Learning Rate Schedulers](Learning_Rate_Schedulers.md)
- [Model Files](Model_Files.md)
- [Prepare Model Notebook](prepare_model.ipynb)

Now let's explore each section in more detail:

## Arduino Deployment

The Arduino Deployment section provides instructions and guidelines for deploying the project on Arduino-compatible boards. It includes information on prerequisites, installation steps, code overview, and usage instructions.
